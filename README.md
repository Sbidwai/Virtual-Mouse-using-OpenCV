# Virtual-Mouse-using-OpenCV

Here, I've made a Windows-based application which can be used for controlling mouse with
hand gestures using web cam input in Java. It can be used for mouse events like single click,
double click, drag etc.The application detects the hand movements given by user and performs
operation accordingly. User can perform multiple tasks with his gestures. No additional hard-
wares will be required.

We have used the OpenCV library for handling and manipulating input from the web cam.
Direction of movement of hand determines the movement of mouse pointer and gesture from the
user determines the operation which is to be performed.
